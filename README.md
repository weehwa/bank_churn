Customers plays a big part in banking industries where they contributes to the growth of banks through despoits , loans, investments and many more activties they can participate. Banks are offerring more and wider variety of products in return for consumer loyalty. Due to todays's easy access to details and promotions, banks are having issue of consumers moving to their competitors for added value or better returns. Today as internet and informations are updated real time, banks are continuing to improve on their service, products and managing the respond timing to provide more transparent and rewarding banking expereince for consumers. However banks are looking into anticipating the ideal type of demographic for bank churn as to zoom in and retain them through more personalised services, hence i would like to create a machine learning model to anticipate bank churn. 

For this study i would be taking Churn_Modelling.csv from kaggle. 
ref: https://www.kaggle.com/adammaus/predicting-churn-for-bank-customers

For this study i will break down into 3 parts namely:
Part A : Read and clean data
Part B : Explore and Analysis data
Part C : Machine Learning 

We would first read and clean the data, check for any missing value and undestanding the dataset. Secondly we would explore and try to analysis the data with some questions as guidelines. Lastly we would try to use 4 models namely,: 'KNN, Logistic Regression, Guassian Naive Bayes and Random forest to test on their performance on this dataset, after which we would select the best performance model through measurements of confusion metrix, F1 score and ROC curve and lastly we will do fine tuning to the best model.

Below are the questions we would try to answer with this dataset and to find some insights for analysis:
1) What is the relationship between age and bank churn in different country?
2) What is the relationship of Credit Score, gender and bank churn?
3) Does active members with longer tenure means low exit rate?
4) Does having a credit card and more products have a lower tendency of bank churn?
5) What is the relationship between estimated salary and age?
6) What is the correlation-ship  between the elements?
